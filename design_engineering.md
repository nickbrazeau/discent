# Design Engineering

## TODO 

- [x] Update for M new specification
- [x] Test for M with new specifications
- [x] Convert momentum to ADAM 



## PSO hyperparameters
According to the paper by M. Clerc and J. Kennedy [3] to define a standard for Particle Swarm Optimization, the best static parameters are w=0.72984 and c1 + c2 > 4. More exactly c1 = c2 = 2.05. Additionally, the linear decay of the parameter w was initially proposed by Yuhui and Russ Y. H. Shi and R. C. Eberhart [4].
