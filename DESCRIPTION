Description: In the early 1970s, Mal√©cot described the relationship between genetic relatedness 
            and physical distance, forming the framework of isolation by distance, or -- put simply --
            pairs that are far apart are less likely to mate. Capitalizing on this framework by using measures
            of Identity by Descent, we produce a deme inbreeding spatial coefficient (DISC) using "vanilla" gradient descent.
            For the mathematical formulation of the of DISC, see: <TODO>. Briefly, we assume that the relatedness 
            between two locations (demes) in space is given by the average pairwise IBD between the two locations conditional
            on the distance that seperates them. Further, we assume that geographic distance is scaled by a migration rate, 
            which is a global parameter among all spatial locations.
